                <h1>I love websites</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name is Ondřej Bilynský, and I am from the Czech Republic, from the city of České Budějovice (where the famous Budweiser beer comes from). Around 2020, a friend and I decided to start creating websites, even though we knew almost nothing about it. I enjoyed the process of web development. It’s not a monotonous job. Every customer wants something different.</p>
                <p>I decided to dive deeper into it and do the work with quality. I started learning to program and completed the Full Stack Engineer course on Codecademy.com.</p>
                <p>The course included, among other things: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and backend development.</p>
